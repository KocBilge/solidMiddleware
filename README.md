**🔥 Installation:**

composer require KocBilge/solidMiddleware
```

**▶️ What Works?:**
### **Middleware in Laravel:**
Middleware in Laravel acts as a gatekeeper for incoming HTTP requests, managing and modifying responses during the application's request processing. 🚧

Each middleware contains a `handle` method, executing operations before passing control to the next middleware or the final processing point (e.g., a controller). Middleware can be organized in a chain, enabling sequential processing of the same request by multiple middleware. ⛓️

### **MaintenanceMode Middleware:**
- MaintenanceMode middleware checks if the application is in maintenance mode. 🛠️
- If it's in maintenance mode, it displays a maintenance page to the user.
- The `app()->isDownForMaintenance()` function determines if the app is in maintenance mode.

### **ExampleMiddleware:**
- ExampleMiddleware logs the incoming HTTP request. 📝
- The `handle` method uses the RequestLogger class to log the request.
- RequestLogger takes the incoming request's information, transforms it into a log message, and writes it to a file.

These middleware can shape or customize the application's behavior. Security controls, authentication, and permission checks can also be implemented using middleware. Middleware stands out as a crucial component that empowers Laravel with versatility and strength. 🌐💪
